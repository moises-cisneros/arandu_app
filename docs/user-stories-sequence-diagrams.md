# Sequence Diagrams - ARANDU User Stories

This document describes the flows of the main User Stories in the ARANDU system using sequence diagrams.

## General Architecture

The ARANDU system follows a **Trusted Backend** pattern where:

* A centralized backend controls the "owner" addresses of the contracts
* Critical functions are protected with `onlyOwner`
* Users interact primarily through the frontend/backend, not directly with the contracts

## Implementation Considerations

### Security

* All critical functions are protected with `onlyOwner`
* Soulbound tokens (certificates and badges) are non-transferable
* The reward system is centralized to prevent abuse

### Scalability

* Contracts are designed to be gas-efficient
* Complex logic is handled off-chain by the backend
* Metadata is stored on IPFS to reduce costs

### User Experience

* Users do not pay gas directly
* Transactions are handled by the trusted backend
* The interface abstracts blockchain complexity

### Auditability and Transparency

* All important events emit logs on-chain
* Critical data hashes are anchored for verification
* The system enables independent audits of transactions
